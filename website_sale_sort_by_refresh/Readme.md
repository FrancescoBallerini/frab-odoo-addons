# Website Sale: Sort By Refresh

This module will remove the active Sort By query when refreshing e-Commerce page by
clicking a link object (e.g a category item).

This can improve user experience in case you have thousands of products, as some of your
Sort queries might be really taxing for performance: when user choose another category
the Sort query will not be performed until the user select the Sort By option again.

## Usage

Install the module to automatically enable this behaviour, uninstall module to
deactivate it.

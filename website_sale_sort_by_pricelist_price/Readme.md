# Website Sale: Sort By Pricelist Price

In odoo14 e-Commerce it's not possible to sort by pricelist price: the Sort By button
only allows to sort by `Sales Price`, which is a fixed value for the customer prices.
This module allows to sort by `Price`, which is the price field having pricelist items
compatibility.

## Usage

In your shop page click 'Customize' menu you will find a new option <b>Sort By -
Pricelist Price</b> which is enabled by default at module installation.

To restore the original behaviour you can either disable the option or uninstall the
module.

## Note

This module requires to install
[product_sort_by_price_base](https://github.com/FrancescoBallerini/odoo14_custom_modules/product_sort_by_price_base)

## Roadmap

- compatibility with product variant prices
